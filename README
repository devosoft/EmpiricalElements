This poject contains the most heavily used code from Empirical that can be used
without any includes or dependencies beyond the C++ standard library.  Our goal
is to simplify the incorporation of these files into new projects.

Most of the files here are originally from the Empirical source/tools/ folder,
but modified to use the (less safe) std:: version of classes, templates, and
asserts.  Each file will be marked in its header when it was last converted.

The full Empirical library is available at:
